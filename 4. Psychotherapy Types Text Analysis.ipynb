       "'humanistic therapy is a mental health approach that emphasizes the importance of being your true self in order to lead the most fulfilling life it s based on the principle that everyone has their own unique way of looking at the world this view can impact your choices and actions humanistic therapy also involves a core belief that people are good at heart and capable of making the right choices for themselves if you don t hold yourself in high regard it s harder to develop your full potential humanistic therapy involves better understanding your world view and developing true self acceptance this is accomplished partially through the development of unconditional positive regard both from others and from yourself when you believe that others only respect you if you act a certain way it s easy to fall into the trap of constantly feeling like you aren t enough this feeling of worthlessness in turn can negatively impact how you view both yourself and the world around you remember according to the underlying principles of humanistic therapy how you view yourself and the world around you has a big impact on your thoughts and actions humanistic therapy can help you to both develop self acceptance and overcome criticism or disapproval from others by offering a safe space to work toward personal growth there are ways of doing this which we ll go over later to start humanistic therapy tends to focus more on your current day to day life similarly humanistic therapy also focuses more on helping the individual as a whole a humanistic therapist will often do this through active listening this means that they ll listen carefully to your words making sure they fully understand what you re saying they may stop you to ask follow up questions humanistic therapists work from the idea that you are the expert in your difficulties they ll support the direction you take each session trusting you to know what you need to talk about in order to work through the things bringing you to therapy humanistic therapy also known as humanism is a form of talk therapy that focuses on a person s individual nature rather than assuming that groups of people with similar characteristics have the same concerns humanistic therapists aim to consider the whole person especially their positive characteristics and potential for growth not only from their professional viewpoint but from a client s own personal sense of their behaviour the emphasis in sessions is on a person s positive traits and behaviours and developing their ability to use their instincts to find wisdom growth healing and fulfillment humanistic therapy can be used to treat people with depression anxiety panic disorders personality disorders schizophrenia addiction and interpersonal and familial relationship concerns the approach can also benefit people who have low self esteem who are struggling with finding a purpose or reaching their potential who lack feelings of wholeness who are searching for personal meaning or who are not comfortable with themselves as they are humanistic therapy sessions encompass a gestalt approach exploring how a person feels in the here and now rather than trying to identify past events that led to these feelings a humanistic therapist seeks to provide an atmosphere of support empathy and trust in which an individual can share their feelings without fear of judgment the therapist does not assume the role of an authority figure with clients the relationship is one of equals and wherever possible the direction of sessions is determined by the client and their concerns in the moment as the expert on their own life and challenges no humanistic values are a central part of multiple forms of therapy some humanistic therapists practice person centered therapy some rely on gestalt therapy practices some employ narrative therapy some offer existential therapy and a number may use elements of all of these modalities no matter a professional s chosen approach successful humanistic therapy depends on establishing the following conditions unconditional positive regard the therapist remains empathetic and non judgmental as they hear and accept the client s statements they convey understanding trust and confidence so that they can encourage clients to feel valued in discovering and making more positive choices empathetic understanding the therapist fully understands and accepts an individual s thoughts and feelings in a way that enables the individual to reshape their sense of their experiences congruence or genuineness the therapist brings no air of superiority or authority to sessions but presents an accessible face that clients see is honest and transparent when humanistic therapy succeeds people experience themselves as well understood by their therapist which should help them feel more empowered more conscious of their strengths and skills and better equipped to make changes in their life that will help them fulfill their goals and needs humanistic therapy emerged in the late s out of a perceived need to address what some psychologists saw as the limitations and negative emphases of behavioural and psychoanalytic schools of therapy they developed humanism as a new more holistic approach less focused on pathology past experiences and environmental influences on behaviour and more on the positive side of human nature around this time abraham maslow developed his hierarchy of human needs and motivations and carl rogers developed his person centered approach to therapy both of these thinkers and their theories influenced the development of humanistic therapy a core tenet of humanistic therapy is that people are inherently motivated to fulfill their internal needs and that each of us has the power to find the best solutions for ourselves and the ability to make appropriate changes in our lives a concept known as self actualization humanistic therapies focus on self development growth and responsibilities to help individuals recognise their strengths creativity and choice by working with a humanistic counsellor you are supported in identifying and overcoming any blocks that are preventing you from achieving your full potential the humanistic approaches are based on the belief that we all naturally gravitate towards goodness while of course difficult life experiences may temporarily block our ability to reach our potential with the right support we all have the ability to achieve our goals a humanistic therapist will work to create a safe supportive space where clients will be able to explore themselves and their potential ultimately working towards developing their own personal growth mentally emotionally and spiritually the humanistic approaches are especially suited to anyone feeling lost struggling with low self esteem or generally looking to improve well being humanistic therapists will also work with people living with specific conditions such as anxiety panic disorders addiction depression obsessive compulsive disorder ocd bipolar disorder and schizophrenia people who are having relationship issues including family relationships may also benefit if we value independence if we are disturbed by the growing conformity of knowledge of values of attitudes which our present system induces then we may wish to set up conditions of learning which make for uniqueness for self direction and for self initiated learning humanistic therapy is all about self exploration the following approaches can help you to increase self awareness and direct you towards finding a greater sense of purpose in life humanistic psychology believes that people are good and focuses on helping people reach their potential by exploring their uniqueness it is based on the assumption that people have free will and are motivated to reach their full potential through self actualization humanistic psychology and humanistic therapy go together as the latter focuses on people s capacity to make rational choices and reach their full potential this therapy approach focuses on the client and allows them to take lead in the conversation it also allows them to discover their true authentic selves and find solutions for their concerns in the process the therapist acts as a non judgmental respectful listener who guides the therapeutic process they acknowledge your experiences without trying to shift the conversation in another direction important assumptions of humanistic psychology include feelings thoughts perception and more are central to how you feel about yourself which is the main indicator of your behaviour your need to reach your full potential is a natural process all people have free will and you need to take responsibility for your behaviours for personal growth and fulfillment people can be good with the right set of conditions especially during childhood a psychologist should treat each case individually as each person is different with unique experiences humanistic psychologists use methods such as unstructured interviews observation and open ended questionnaires in unstructured interviews the therapist seeks to understand how you think and feel without focusing the session on any particular topics or ideas they also observe you during sessions making it easy for you to be open and give direct feedback psychologists who use this form of therapy tailor treatment to the individual since they understand that every person is different with unique needs and motives humanistic therapy adopts a holistic approach that focuses on free will human potential and self discovery it aims to help you develop a strong and healthy sense of self explore your feelings find meaning and focus on your strengths empathy the therapist seeks to understand you empathy allows the therapist to relate to your experiences from their perspective unconditional positive regard this means that the therapist shows warmth is receptive and is nonjudgmental they avoid coming across as an authoritative figure humanistic therapy describes a range of different types of therapy that focus on a person as an individual with unique potential and abilities instead of concentrating on what is wrong with people this type of therapy is more focused on helping them overcome their difficulties through personal growth humanistic therapy grew out of humanistic psychology a perspective that stresses that people are innately good this approach tends to be more holistic and looks at the whole person rather than just a single area of a person s life by emphasizing a person s skills and positive characteristics it encourages people to heal and find personal fulfillment humanistic therapy is an umbrella term that encompasses a number of different types of therapy the specific type of humanistic therapy that is right for you may depend on your goals and what symptoms are being treated umanistic therapists use a number of techniques that are designed to support people as they work toward change some of the main techniques that are frequently used include congruence this technique is essential to humanistic therapy and involves the therapist being authentic open and genuine as they interact with the individual who is in therapy empathetic understanding this involves the therapist not only understanding what the client is feeling and saying but also communicating that understanding to the client the individual should feel heard seen and understood reflective listening this involves actively listening to the individual and then summarizing what the client has said in their own words this strategy can help reinforce what the client is saying allow them to reflect back on their own words and clear up potential misunderstandings unconditional positive regard this technique involves the therapist accepting the individual without judgment it is characterized by a caring attitude that plays an important role in fostering self worth personal growth and self awareness because humanistic therapy is focused on the present it may also utilize a practice known as mindfulness to help people become more aware of themselves and their environment therapists utilize these techniques to support people as they develop greater self awareness these techniques are focused on solving specific problems instead their goal is to encourage people to view themselves as capable of directing their own behaviour and achieving their unique goals one benefit of humanistic therapy is that this approach can be a great source of empathy and support because therapists are trained to be non judgemental and listen with understanding you may feel more comfortable opening up and sharing your feelings humanistic therapy also allows the individual to play an active role in their treatment while the therapist acts as a knowledgeable trusted guide because humanistic therapy focuses on a person s positive qualities it can help people feel more empowered and active in the process of making changes in their lives rather than feeling overwhelmed or dragged down by problems it encourages people to focus on their strengths and use those skills to fulfill their needs this approach to therapy can also be a good way to learn coping skills including problem solving and stress relief that will be helpful whenever you are faced with problems in your life because it fosters self esteem and self efficacy you ll feel more capable as you deal with challenges humanistic therapy rests on the belief that every human is born with unique potential that with the right nurturing can be fully realized this field of psychology strives to foster the potential in individuals via treatment that focuses on their humanistic traits and provides them with positive support because of the individual nature of personal growth humanistic counseling is a personalized mental health treatment crafted to serve your specific needs and goals humanistic therapy puts you at the center of your treatments and allows you to guide your sessions humanistic therapy is an effective treatment for a wide range of mental health conditions but is also helpful to those who don t suffer from mental illness symptoms but instead want to grow as a person instead of working on a diagnostic criteria humanistic therapy focuses on personal understandings of the individual as a person humanistic therapy was founded on the following core concepts at their core humans are good and naturally strive to better both themselves and their world people seek to self actualize become the best version of themselves people have unique subjective experiences which can and should serve as the starting point of their therapy therapy should focus on understanding a person holistically humanistic therapy is an approach to mental health that uses a strong relationship between the client and therapist to allow people to explore and reach their fullest potential it s useful for anyone who is feeling frustrated or stuck in anxiety depression or general life difficulties that said it isn t focused on learning tools to fix problems and the length of therapy depends on your own unique needs and goals humanistic therapy is an umbrella term for a group of talk therapies based on the principles of humanism which relates to human nature and potential individuals not their challenges are the primary focus they re seen as highly valuable unique and capable of achieving their goals the therapist isn t there to diagnose problem solve or lead instead they re an equal partner on a journey of meaningful growth the emphasis of humanistic therapy is on individual choice freedom values and meaning to help people find fulfillment and purpose by living meaningfully in the present a concept known as mindfulness people can break free from past experiences or concerns for the future this allows them to act with purpose and passion for their own benefit and the benefit of society a humanistic therapist sees people as being inherently good deserving of unconditional positive regard respect empathy and understanding for who they are rather than judgement motivated to meet their own needs and grow capable of solving problems and making necessary changes to overcome obstacles driven to self actualize to define personal meaning take purposeful action and use their unique strengths and talents to live to their full potential complete and whole more than a collection of random experiences and problems humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective that arose in the mid th century in answer to two theories sigmund freud s psychoanalytic theory and b f skinner s behaviourism thus abraham maslow established the need for a third force in psychology the school of thought of humanistic psychology gained traction due to key figure abraham maslow in the s during the time of the humanistic movement it was made popular in the s by the process of realizing and expressing one s own capabilities and creativity humanistic psychology aims to help the client gain the belief that all people are inherently good it adopts a holistic approach to human existence and pays special attention to such phenomena as creativity free will and positive human potential it encourages viewing ourselves as a whole person greater than the sum of our parts and encourages self exploration rather than the study of behaviour in other people humanistic psychology acknowledges spiritual aspiration as an integral part of the psyche it is linked to the emerging field of transpersonal psychology primarily this type of therapy encourages a self awareness and reflexivity that helps the client change their state of mind and behaviour from one set of reactions to a healthier one with more productive self awareness and thoughtful actions essentially this approach allows the merging of mindfulness and behavioural therapy with positive social support in an article from the association for humanistic psychology the benefits of humanistic therapy are described as having a crucial opportunity to lead our troubled culture back to its own healthy path more than any other therapy humanistic existential therapy models democracy it imposes ideologies of others upon the client less than other therapeutic practices freedom to choose is maximized we validate our clients human potential achieve growth best when treated with unconditional positive regard these concepts are the foundation of humanistic therapy when maslow and rogers were engaging in their research this was a unique and novel approach emphasizing a new way of looking at mental health now that it has become a recognized discipline humanistic therapy has helped countless individuals to live to their full potential a therapist practicing a humanistic approach will be open minded and positive in their approach to you and the issues you d like to focus on they will work to empathize with what you re experiencing and support you during sessions humanistic therapy is a non judgemental space where you will take an active role in shaping to match your mental health needs some of the most common humanistic therapies include gestalt therapy client centered therapy and existential therapy all of which can be used in tandem or separately based on what best fits you there are many ways that humanistic therapy benefits clients and their mental health the positivity channeled in this type of therapy leads to empowering personal growth for those participating in treatment having a non judgmental space to process emotions and experiences can do wonders in treating mental health conditions and humanistic therapy s holistic approach ensures all aspects as opposed to simply early childhood or the present are processed the individualistic focus of humanistic therapy also helps you learn problem solving and self soothing skills which can help when struggling with the stress and anxiety of daily life humanistic therapy can also increase self esteem and promote an active approach in your life'"

    "After some experimenting with the parameters and number of topics it seems that the model can pick up some of the groups pretty well, such as art and expression, body-oriented, or unconscious oriented. However, there can be inaccuracies due to use of similar words in completely different ways. For example, \"child\" and \"parent\" can be used in context of childhood experiences and relationship with the parents, but they can also be used to refer to inner processes, such as Child and Parent ego-states in transactional analysis. This can lead to seemingly different modalities being grouped together.\n",
