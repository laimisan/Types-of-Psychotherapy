# Types-of-Psychotherapy

Analysis and visualisation of main types of psychotherapy available in the UK (based on BACP register).

The purpose of this project was to create a tool that would make it easier for people to find therapy that is suitable to them.
There are hundreds of types of therapy, the information about what's available is spread out between different sources, 
and the articles are lengthy and hard to understand - and sometimes even contradictory.

I have addressed these issues by:
* Using the data from one of the main governing bodies, BACP. This will point out the main types of psychotherapy out there,
as well as their popularity/availability.
* Using NLP techniques on a combination of different articles describing psychotherapy types to gain insight into what aspects
are at the core, i.e. would be mentioned most often, regardless of the source.
* Grouping therapy types based on identified similarities between their descriptions and features.
* Vissualising the information using an interactive sunburst chart, which:
  i) provides a quick understanding of the main types of therapy, and how they differ
  ii) show how widely these therapy types are available
  iii) provides a core summary of each type when hovering over with a cursor.
  
Ideally, this would point the reader to the right direction by invoking a curiosity about therapies that seem like a right fit for them,
while also allowing them do discard the ones that don't - all in one place.
