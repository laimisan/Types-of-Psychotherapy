# Types-of-Psychotherapy

Analysis of the main types of psychotherapy available in the UK (based on BACP and UKCP registers) using Python.

The purpose of this project was to create a visualisation that would make it easier for people to understand what type of psychotherapy
is available, as well as get a feel for what is right for them.

The main issues that I have identified and that have motivated this project are: 
* There are hundreds of types of therapy 
* The information about what's available is spread out between different sources
* The articles are lengthy and hard to understand - and sometimes even contradictory.

I have addressed them by:
* Using the data from the main governing bodies, BACP and UKCP. This will point out the main types of psychotherapy out there,
as well as their popularity/availability while ensuring data integrity.
* Using NLP techniques on a combination of different articles describing psychotherapy types to gain insight into what aspects
are at the core, i.e. would be mentioned most often, regardless of the source.
* Grouping therapy types based on identified similarities between their descriptions and features.
* Vissualising the information by building two infographics.
  
Ideally, this would point the reader to the right direction by invoking a curiosity about therapies that seem like a right fit for them,
and providing a mental framework to base deeper research on.
